# Mobile Coding Challenge

Using the provided service based around gRPC, build out a mobile application that allows a user to see a collection of bank accounts and selecting a bank shows the transactions for that account. There are three aspects of this challenge we are interested in.

1. Use of the provided docker container to spin up the gRPC service locally.
2. Given the provided protoc file, generate and integrate the gRPC client.
3. Build a mobile application based on the below requirements.

## Requirements

The mobile application you would build should allow for the following:

1. Use of the provided docker container to spin up the gRPC service.
2. Given the protocol file, generate the appropriate client code and implement.
3. Build UI to showcase the data provided by the service using the provided wireframes.
   * Create a basic landing page (for bonus points, use the provided Lottie animation while loading the data)
   * Once the data has been fetched, show the result as per the wireframe.
   * Selecting a UI element should move the user into a detail view. Use your imagination as to how you would show this information.
